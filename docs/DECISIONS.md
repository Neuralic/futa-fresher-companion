# Decisions (append new ones at the bottom)

| # | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Architecture diagram is the agreed plan | Team decision |
| 2 | Website first, mobile app later | Faster to ship; one codebase |
| 3 | Web is an installable **PWA** with offline + low-data support | Fast on Android/iOS, tiny download vs. app stores |
| 4 | Backend "services" are modules inside **one FastAPI app** | Same boundaries as the diagram, one thing to deploy and debug. Split into separate services only if there is a real need. |
| 5 | API contract (`docs/openapi.yaml`) and DB migrations are frozen; changes via lead-approved PR | Lets frontend/backend/data work in parallel without breaking each other |
| 6 | Plain-SQL migrations (`db/migrate.py`), PostGIS from day one | Simple to read and review; map/geo data needs it |
| 7 | `/sync` endpoint feeds an IndexedDB (Dexie) cache | One small request keeps the offline cache fresh |
